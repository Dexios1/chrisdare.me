          I am a computer science grad and former analyst in financial services and gaining ground in artificial intelligence at Carngie Mellon. 
          Currently building strong expertise at the intersection of communication, data science/machine learning, product management and software engineering. 
          I intend to use what I learn in this next phase of my life to research, design, build and 
          manage analytics/cognitive products that solve critical and pressing problems my continent and the rest of the world is facing. 
          </p>

          <p class="subtitle">This semester at CMU, I am focussing on writing efficient data structures/algorithms, deep learning models as well as processing natural language 
          and engaging in human-centered design.

              I do some pretty interesting work with Rwanda's Revenue Authority. 
              By day, I work with the data science team to create a decision support system to detect fradulent consignments declared for import. 
              Our objectives are to facilitate trade at Rwanda's borders and increase revenue generation.
              By night, I sleep :-). <br>
              Actually, by night (3/5) and weekends, I spend time with a top secret team building a secretive closed circle social platform.   
              <br>

            Everyone - including me - says I should upgrade my website. But, bayesian statistics tell me that's really bleak at the moment. (Update, July 2020: Still bleak)

              We're in tough times, people. Stay safe and take charge. 
              Whoever's working on a COVID vaccine, we're rooting for you.
              The world will not be the same when this is all over...but it'll certainly will be better than it is now.
