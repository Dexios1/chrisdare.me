          I am a computer science grad and former analyst in financial services and gaining ground in artificial intelligence at Carngie Mellon. 
          Currently building strong expertise at the intersection of communication, data science/machine learning, product management and software engineering. 
          I intend to use what I learn in this next phase of my life to research, design, build and 
          manage analytics/cognitive products that solve critical and pressing problems my continent and the rest of the world is facing. 
          </p>

          <p class="subtitle">This semester at CMU, I am focussing on writing efficient data structures/algorithms, deep learning models as well as processing natural language 
          and engaging in human-centered design.

            Everyone - including me - says I should upgrade my website. But, bayesian statistics tell me that's really bleak at the moment.
